   - Evaluate scalability and maintainability
   - Suggest architectural improvements

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Analyze time and space complexity
   - Suggest optimization opportunities
   - Evaluate resource usage

4. **Security Analysis**
   - Identify security vulnerabilities
   - Review authentication and authorization
   - Check for common security issues
   - Suggest security improvements

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Code Quality

#### Readability
- Is the code easy to understand?
- Are names clear and descriptive?
- Is the code properly formatted?
- Are comments helpful and up-to-date?

#### Maintainability
- Is the code well-structured?
- Are there appropriate abstractions?
- Is coupling minimized?
- Is the code testable?

#### Correctness
- Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are there any obvious bugs?

### 2. Design Patterns

#### Good Patterns
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Injection
- Interface Segregation

#### Anti-Patterns to Flag
- God objects
- Spaghetti code
- Magic numbers/strings
- Tight coupling
- Circular dependencies
- Premature optimization

### 3. Performance

#### Common Issues
- Inefficient algorithms
- Unnecessary computations
- Memory leaks
- N+1 queries
- Blocking operations
- Excessive network calls

#### Optimization Opportunities
- Caching
- Lazy loading
- Batching operations
- Async processing
- Data structure improvements

### 4. Security

#### Common Vulnerabilities
- SQL injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Authentication issues
- Authorization bypasses
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure dependencies

#### Security Best Practices
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Parameterized queries
- Proper authentication
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure defaults

### 5. Testing

#### Test Coverage
- Are critical paths tested?
- Are edge cases tested?
- Are error cases tested?
- Is coverage adequate?

#### Test Quality
- Are tests clear and focused?
- Are tests independent?
- Are tests deterministic?
- Are tests maintainable?

## Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Review
- Understand the purpose and context
- Review the overall structure
- Identify main components
- Note initial observations

### 2. Detailed Analysis
- Review code line by line
- Check against best practices
- Identify specific issues
- Note improvement opportunities

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- Identify recurring patterns
- Spot anti-patterns
- Evaluate design decisions
- Assess consistency

### 4. Impact Assessment
- Categorize issues by severity
- Assess risk and impact
- Prioritize findings
- Consider effort to fix

### 5. Recommendations
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Explain the reasoning
- Suggest alternatives
- Prioritize recommendations

## Issue Severity Levels

### Critical
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- System crashes
- Breaking changes

### High
- Major bugs
- Performance issues
- Poor error handling
- Significant design flaws

### Medium
- Code quality issues
- Missing tests
- Documentation gaps
- Minor design issues

### Low
- Style inconsistencies
- Optimization opportunities
- Refactoring suggestions
- Documentation improvements

## Output Format

### Issue Report

For each issue found:

```markdown
**[SEVERITY] Issue Title**

**Location**: file.js:123

**Description**:
Clear description of the issue

**Impact**:
What problems this causes

**Recommendation**:
How to fix it

**Example**:
```javascript
// Bad
badExample()

// Good
goodExample()
```
```
