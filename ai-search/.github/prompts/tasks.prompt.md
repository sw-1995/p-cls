## Task Board Structure

### Sprint Planning

```markdown
# Sprint [Number] - [Date Range]

## Sprint Goals
1. Goal 1
2. Goal 2
3. Goal 3

## Capacity
- Team size: X developers
- Sprint length: Y days
- Estimated capacity: Z points

## Committed Work
[Tasks committed for this sprint]

## Stretch Goals
[Tasks to attempt if capacity allows]
```

### Daily Status

```markdown
## In Progress
- [TASK-XXX] Task name - [Assignee]
  - Status: On track | At risk | Blocked
  - Updated: [Timestamp]

## Ready for Review
- [TASK-XXX] Task name - [Reviewer]

## Done Today
- [TASK-XXX] Task name - Completed by [Name]

## Blockers
- [TASK-XXX] Task name
  - Blocker: [Description]
  - Owner: [Name]
  - Action: [Next steps]
```

### Backlog Organization

```markdown
## Now (Current Sprint)
[Current sprint tasks]

## Next (Next Sprint)
[Planned for next sprint]

## Later (Backlog)
[Future work]

## Icebox (Maybe Someday)
[Low priority or uncertain items]
```

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

### Feature Breakdown

For a new feature:
1. **Design tasks**
   - Specification
   - Technical design
   - UI/UX design

2. **Implementation tasks**
   - Core functionality
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling
   - Integration

3. **Testing tasks**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Performance tests

4. **Documentation tasks**
   - Code documentation
   - API documentation
   - User documentation

5. **Deployment tasks**
   - Configuration
   - Migration scripts
   - Deployment plan
   - Rollback plan

### Bug Fix Breakdown

For a bug fix:
1. **Investigation**
   - Reproduce issue
   - Identify root cause
   - Determine scope

2. **Fix**
   - Implement solution
   - Add tests
   - Verify fix

3. **Validation**
   - Test in all environments
   - Verify no regressions
   - Document resolution

### Task Size Guidelines

#### Small (S) - 1-4 hours
- Simple bug fixes
- Minor updates
- Small refactorings
- Documentation updates

#### Medium (M) - 4-16 hours
- Standard features
- Moderate refactorings
- Integration work
- Complex bug fixes

#### Large (L) - 16+ hours
- Major features
- Architectural changes
- Large refactorings
- System integrations

**Note**: If a task is larger than 2-3 days, break it down further.

## Task Management Best Practices

### Writing Good Tasks

**Good Task**:
```markdown
**Implement user authentication API**

- Add POST /api/auth/login endpoint
- Validate email and password
- Return JWT token on success
- Handle invalid credentials
- Add rate limiting
- Write unit and integration tests
```

**Poor Task**:
```markdown
**Do auth stuff**

- Make auth work
- Test it
```

### Dependency Management

- Identify dependencies early
- Visualize dependency graph
- Work on independent tasks in parallel
- Minimize critical path
- Communicate dependency changes

### Blocker Management

**When Blocked**:
1. Document the blocker clearly
2. Identify who can unblock
3. Set a follow-up date
4. Find alternative work
5. Escalate if needed

**Blocker Template**:
```markdown
**Blocker**: [TASK-XXX] Task name

**Issue**: Clear description of what's blocking

**Impact**: What's affected and how urgent

**Owner**: Who can resolve this

**Action**: What needs to happen

**Status**: Last update and next steps

**Deadline**: When this becomes critical
```

## Reporting and Metrics

### Sprint Metrics

- **Velocity**: Points completed per sprint
- **Burndown**: Remaining work over time
- **Completion Rate**: % of committed work done
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to done
- **Lead Time**: Time from creation to done

### Health Indicators

- **Work In Progress**: Number of active tasks
- **Blocker Count**: Number of blocked tasks
- **Age of Oldest Task**: Time since oldest task created
- **Pull Request Age**: Time PRs waiting for review

### Status Reports

```markdown
## Sprint Status - [Date]

### Progress
- Completed: X/Y tasks (Z%)
- In Progress: A tasks
- Blocked: B tasks

### On Track
- [Tasks progressing well]

### At Risk
- [Tasks at risk of missing deadline]

### Completed This Week
- [Notable completions]

### Blockers
- [Current blockers and actions]

### Next Week

```

## Communication Templates

### Task Update
```markdown
**Update: [TASK-XXX] Task name**

Status: [Status]
Progress: [% or description]
Blockers: [Any blockers]
Next Steps: [What's next]
ETA: [Expected completion]
```

### Status Request
```markdown
Hi [Name],

Could you provide an update on [TASK-XXX]?

Specifically:
- Current status
- Any blockers
- Expected completion date
