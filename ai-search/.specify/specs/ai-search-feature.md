# Feature Specification: AI Search for PatentCloud

## Overview

### Purpose

AI Search addresses the seven critical bottlenecks that plague patent search practitioners: vocabulary mismatch, classification complexity, multilingual barriers, data quality issues, screening costs, special content handling, and inexperienced search strategies. By combining natural language understanding, semantic analysis, and intelligent query construction, AI Search transforms patent searching from a manual, iterative guessing game into a guided, data-driven discovery process.

### Goals

1. **Reduce Time-to-First-Relevant-Result** by 60% through intelligent query construction and synonym expansion
2. **Increase Recall** by 40% by automatically discovering adjacent classifications and multilingual equivalents
3. **Decrease False Positive Screening Time** by 50% through AI-powered relevance ranking and result clustering
4. **Enable Non-Experts** to achieve 80% of expert search quality through guided workflows and automated error detection
5. **Surface Hidden Prior Art** in non-obvious classifications, foreign languages, and non-patent literature

### Non-Goals

**This feature does NOT aim to:**
- Replace human judgment in legal validity or infringement analysis
- Guarantee exhaustive prior art searches (users remain responsible for completeness)
- Handle image-based searches for design patents or circuit layouts (future roadmap item)
- Perform automated patentability assessments or generate legal opinions
- Replace specialized chemistry/biotech structure search tools (Markush, sequence alignment)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Intelligent Query Construction (Bottleneck 1)

**Problem Addressed:** Synonyms, jargon, acronyms, and evolving terminology cause vocabulary mismatch; users struggle with recall vs. precision balance.

**Requirements:**
1. **Automatic Synonym Expansion**
   - Detect technical terms and suggest domain-specific synonyms
   - Include common acronyms and their expansions (e.g., "BMS" → "Battery Management System", "Building Management System")
   - Identify evolving terminology (e.g., "self-driving car" → "autonomous vehicle" → "AV")
   - Show all expansions transparently with confidence scores

2. **Precision/Recall Balancing Assistant**
   - Analyze initial query and estimate scope (over-broad vs. over-tight)
   - Suggest field scoping (title-only for precision, full-text for recall)
   - Recommend proximity operators when contextually appropriate
   - Provide "broaden" and "narrow" suggestions with examples

3. **Query Quality Scoring**
   - Evaluate query structure and provide actionable feedback
   - Flag missing components (e.g., "No classification filter—results may be unfocused")
   - Suggest improvements based on historical successful searches

#### FR2: Classification Intelligence (Bottleneck 2)

**Problem Addressed:** Knowing which CPC/IPC subclasses map to a concept is non-trivial; adjacent classes often contain relevant art.

**Requirements:**
1. **Smart Classification Mapping**
   - Accept natural language concept descriptions
   - Map to primary CPC/IPC subclasses with confidence scores
   - Suggest adjacent and parent classifications (e.g., "Also consider H01M10/052 [lithium-ion], H02J7/00 [charging circuits]")
   - Explain why each classification is relevant

2. **Cross-Disciplinary Discovery**
   - Identify potential art in unexpected classifications based on semantic analysis
   - Alert users to technology transfer opportunities (e.g., "Battery cooling concepts appear in automotive thermal management H01M10/61 and HVAC F28")
   - Provide visual classification tree navigation

3. **Classification Coverage Analysis**
   - Show distribution of results across classifications
   - Identify over-represented and under-explored classes
   - Suggest expanding search to under-sampled but semantically relevant classes

#### FR3: Multilingual Search Enhancement (Bottleneck 3)

**Problem Addressed:** Relevant art in KR/JP/CN/DE relies on imperfect translations; important nuances get lost in claims.

**Requirements:**
1. **Cross-Lingual Query Expansion**
   - Automatically generate equivalent queries in target languages (KR, JP, CN, DE, FR)
   - Use patent-domain translation models (not generic Google Translate)
   - Preserve technical term meaning across languages

2. **Claim-Aware Translation**
   - Apply higher-quality translation to claims vs. abstracts (claims are legally binding)
   - Highlight translation uncertainty with warnings
   - Offer original-language snippets alongside translations

3. **Local Jargon Detection**
   - Identify region-specific terminology (e.g., Japanese katakana technical terms)
   - Map to standard international equivalents
   - Surface results that machine translation might miss

#### FR4: Data Quality & Normalization (Bottleneck 4)

**Problem Addressed:** Laggy legal status, inconsistent assignee names, family inflation, OCR errors in older PDFs.

**Requirements:**
1. **Smart Assignee Normalization**
   - Unify assignee name variants ("IBM", "International Business Machines", "IBM Corp.")
   - Detect acquisitions and corporate restructuring
   - Provide assignee disambiguation UI

2. **Patent Family De-Duplication**
   - Identify INPADOC families and optionally collapse to representative members
   - Show family coverage by jurisdiction
   - Allow expansion to full family on demand

3. **OCR Error Tolerance**
   - Use fuzzy matching for older patents (pre-2000)
   - Suggest corrections for likely OCR errors (e.g., "cornputer" → "computer")
   - Flag low-OCR-quality documents

#### FR5: Intelligent Result Screening (Bottleneck 5)

**Problem Addressed:** Triaging hundreds/thousands of results is time-consuming; subtle claim scope differences require expert reading.

**Requirements:**
1. **AI-Powered Relevance Ranking**
   - Rank results by semantic similarity to query intent (not just keyword frequency)
   - Prioritize claims-based matches over abstract/title matches
   - De-rank boilerplate text and generic descriptions

2. **Automatic Result Clustering**
   - Group results into conceptual clusters with labels (e.g., "BMS topology", "SoH estimation algorithms", "thermal safety")
   - Show cluster size and representative patents
   - Allow drilling into clusters

3. **Quick Relevance Indicators**
   - Show why each result matched (snippet highlighting with explanation)
   - Display claim scope summary (auto-extracted key limitations)
   - Provide "similar to this" expansion from any result

4. **Active Learning Loop**
   - Allow users to mark results as relevant/irrelevant
   - Retrain ranking in real-time based on feedback
   - Suggest query refinements based on marked examples

#### FR6: Special Content Type Handling (Bottleneck 6)

**Problem Addressed:** Chemistry, biotech, design patents, and NPL don't fit neatly into text search.

**Requirements (MVP Scope):**
1. **NPL Integration**
   - Include non-patent literature sources (IEEE, arXiv, PubMed) in unified results
   - Tag NPL sources clearly
   - Rank NPL by citation count and recency

2. **Chemistry/Biotech Awareness (Limited)**
   - Detect chemical formulas and preserve exact syntax
   - Recognize sequence identifiers (SEQ ID NO:) and link to sequence databases
   - Provide warnings when Markush/sequence search is recommended instead

**Out of Scope for MVP:**
- Markush structure search (requires specialized chemical search engine)
- Design patent image similarity (requires computer vision pipeline)
- Circuit/layout pattern matching (requires EDA tool integration)

#### FR7: Guided Search Strategy (Bottleneck 7)

**Problem Addressed:** Lack of iterative loop; no gold set to measure recall/precision objectively.

**Requirements:**
1. **Search Workflow Assistant**
   - Guide users through iterative refinement: query → sample results → error analysis → refine
   - Show search progress (coverage, classifications explored, languages covered)
   - Suggest next steps ("Try broader classification", "Check German patents", "Review low-confidence results")

2. **Gold Set Creation & Benchmarking**
   - Allow users to tag "known relevant" patents before searching
   - Measure recall against gold set (% of known patents found)
   - Identify which known patents were missed and why

3. **Search History & Learning**
   - Save search sessions with full history (queries, refinements, decisions)
   - Detect patterns in successful searches (e.g., "Battery searches usually need H01M + H02J")
   - Suggest starting points based on similar past searches

4. **Error Analysis Dashboard**
   - Show false negatives (why known patents were missed): wrong classification, vocabulary mismatch, language barrier
   - Show false positives (why irrelevant patents appeared): suggest exclusions
   - Provide actionable recommendations for each error type
